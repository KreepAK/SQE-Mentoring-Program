I was drinking whiskey 'til it's dawn
All I know is I'm far from done
I lay outside to feel the sun
I ain't felt this great in months
I roll my joints, I smoke my blunts
I'll pass it 'round, I might give you some
Can't kill my high, can't kill my buzz
I'll be around 'til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
