I was drinking whiskey 'til it's dawn
All I know is I'm far from done
I lay outside to feel the sun
I ain't felt this great in months
I roll my joints, I smoke my blunts
I'll pass it 'round, I might give you some
Can't kill my high, can't kill my buzz
I'll be around 'til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
Woke up feelin' sideways
Now I'm on the highway
The devil's door in my way, yeah
Might be Monday, might be Friday
I never look behind me
So, I'ma keep on climbing, yeah
All I see is green lights
Fly up in the mountains where the wind whines
I see right
I could build a ladder that reach new heights
Damn this sight
I can see the coast off in the distance
Damn it feels nice
But it could be gone all in an instance
So, raise your glass and spark your jay
I'm on a beach underneath the shade
Surrounded by this purple haze
And I won't stop 'til it's yesterday
I'm drinking whiskey 'til it's dawn
All I know is I'm far from done
I lay outside to feel the sun
I ain't felt this great in months
I roll my joints, I smoke my blunts
I'll pass it 'round, I might give you some
Can't kill my high, can't kill my buzz
I'll be around 'til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
Smoke a cig' up on the porch
Took a tab, now, let's explore
Let the LSD absorb, watch reality distort
Feel like my mind is on tour
Feel like I'm goin', want some more of this
Go open out those doors
Let's go put me on the floor
See the world breathe
I can't hear a thing except my heartbeat
I'm flying into new dimensions you can find me
I'm hiding all way 'cause I feel like life is blinding
I'm tryin' to keep it together while I'm winding
So, I won't spend my night without a fucking plan
Who knows, it might end in Japan
I'll never change that's just how I am
I'ma live today like it's the last I have
I'm drinking whiskey 'til it's dawn
All I know is I'm far from done
I lay outside to feel the sun
I ain't felt this great in months
I roll my joints, I smoke my blunts
I'll pass it 'round, I might give you some
Can't kill my high, can't kill my buzz
I'll be around 'til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
'Til I'm the only one
I'm drinking whiskey out the barrel
I'm drinking whiskey while I was a feral
I'm drinking whiskey, yeah, out the barrel
I'm drinking whiskey, yeah, while I was a feral
So...
I'm drinking whiskey 'til it's done
I might get high, I might get stoned
Enjoy the ride, that's all I want
No one's around, now, I'm the only one
Yeah, I'm the only one (now, I'm the only one)
Yeah, I'm the only one (now, I'm the only one)
Now, I'm the only one (now, I'm the only one)
Yeah, I'm the only one
